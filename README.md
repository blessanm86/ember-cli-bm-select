   * `action (optional)` The name of the action which will be triggered when the selection has changed.

2. __bm-selected__
   This component should be a direct child of `bm-select`. It should be used as a block component where you specify how the selected value should be rendered once the selection is made. The template data use to render is taken from the controller used by bm-select.

###Keyboard Support
You can interact with the component using the keyboard. Once the component has focus you can use the down arrow or enter button to open the options dropdown.

While the dropdown is open you can use the up and down arrow key to move focus between the different options.

While focus is on an option, you can press enter to select that option.

You can press the escape button to close the dropdown.
